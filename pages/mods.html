  <p>During my years in engineer school, I have been working on a few Minecraft mods during my spare time. It was both a
    painful and enriching experience. S/O to my friend <a href="https://github.com/mcdostone"
      target="_blank">Mcdostone</a> for helping me and taking the main project to the next level.
  </p>
  <p>We also worked together on <a href="https://github.com/Chocorean/ClientMinecraftTNCY" target="_blank">a custom
      Minecraft launcher</a>, which we soon abandoned; cool project nonetheless.</p>
