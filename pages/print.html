  <p>I have bought a Creality Ender 3 in December 2020, because I had some time to spend. I have since slightly modded
    it:
  <ul>
    <li>Flashed Marlin 4.2.7</li>
    <li>Installed silent board</li>
    <li>Orange springs and metal wheels</li>
    <li>
      <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Installed BLTouch</span> - I failed to make it work! I should
      definitely give it another shot.
    </li>
    <li>Home-made direct drive</li>
    <li>Custom Bullseye fanduct</li>
    <li>And some decoration !</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>I have made a public account for my <a href="https://print.chocorp.net">Octoprint instance</a>, credentials are
    <i><b>guest / guest </b></i>. Thus the camera live feed is available for everyone to see.
  </p>
  <p>In the future, I would like to try again to automate the upload of timelapses to Youtube: I had a hard time setting
    it up, made it almost working (unfortunately uploaded video were not allowed to go public), and I lost the scripts
    anyway because of a corrupted SD card.</p>
  <p>I would also like to experiment with the Twitch API and automate the start of a stream when I start a print.</p>
  <p>In the mean time, here is my (WIP mini-)gallery:
