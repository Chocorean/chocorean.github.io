  desc: I am currently responsible for the maintenance of the <a href="https://samate.nist.gov/SARD">Software Assurance Reference Dataset</a>, which encompasses
        dependencies and security updates, developping new features, and adding test cases to the database. The SARD
        is developped with <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>.

  desc: I developed two <strong>Rust full-stack applications</strong> for running human evaluations of <strong>AI-generated content</strong>, such as
        texts and pictures. The goal was to gather human feedback before training AI systems to detect whether a
        document was AI-generated. They are not available to the public at the moment.

  desc: My mission was to automate the generation of
        <strong>deepfakes</strong> using several open-source <strong>Deep Learning</strong> tools, such as
        <a href="https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab" target="_blank">DeepFaceLab</a> or <a
          href="https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap" target="_blank">FaceSwap</a>. It resulted in many
        thousands of videos for the project's dataset. I oversaw a student, helping him to run deepfakes tools on
        <strong>GPU-accelerated hardware</strong>, with <strong>Python</strong>, virtual environments, code reviews, and
        best practices for coding. I was also involved in several workshops, presenting the dataset's generation
        pipeline and content to performers and stakeholders.

  desc: I was a member of the team dedicated to the <a href="https://actev.nist.gov" target="_blank">ActEV challenge</a>
        sponsored by IARPA. I am responsible for maintenance and development of new features for two projects, an abstract
        CLI that our partners have to implement, then submit to our pipeline, and a scorer software which evaluates our
        partners software's performance. Additionally, I had to reimagine the CI for the abstract CLI because it became harder
        to test. I am also responsible for the generation of some ActEV datasets.

  desc: The goal of the internship was to create from scratch a data leak orchestration tool, which would store any leaked credential of the company's customers, for monitoring purposes. I designed the software as a web API for ease of use by the other tools of the company. I have used an analytical database called <strong>ClickHouse</strong>, which is currently holding billions of leaked credentials and has crazy fast response times. It is currently part of the firm's monitoring offer.
