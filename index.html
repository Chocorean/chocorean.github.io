Welcome to my blog! I will not publish a lot here, but I hope the little I do
will help people where I already struggled. Have fun!

<hr class="sep" />

I am still building this website:

<style>
  .done {
    text-decoration: line-through;
  }
</style>

<ul>
  <li class="done"> resume</li>
  <li class="done">3d printer 1st draft</li>
  <li>mods 1st draft</li>
  <li>blog home page: css</li>
  <li>redirect chocorp.net here</li>
</ul>
